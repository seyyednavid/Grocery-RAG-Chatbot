A: Yes. Select stores and our app carry men’s, women’s, and kids’ clothing, as well as casual footwear. Sizes and selection vary by location. If a size is out of stock at your preferred store, check nearby stores or order for delivery/pickup if available.



### 0005

Q: What is the Delivery Club and how much does it cost?

A: Delivery Club is our unlimited delivery membership: $100 per year for free deliveries on eligible orders. Without membership, delivery is $10 per order. Delivery Club does not change product prices or tips; it removes the per-delivery fee.

### 0008

Q: When are delivery windows available? Can I reschedule?

A: Delivery windows typically run from 8am–10pm, with 1–2 hour slots depending on your area. You can reschedule or cancel up to 1 hour before your slot in Orders > Upcoming. After that cutoff, changes may not be possible.



### 0009

### 0010

Q: What is your substitutions policy for delivery and pickup?

A: By default, shoppers will offer close substitutions if an item is out of stock. You can: (1) allow substitutions, (2) choose “no substitutions,” or (3) add specific notes (e.g., “any brand whole-milk 1L”). If a substitute costs less, you pay the lower price; if it costs more, you pay the substituted item’s price.



### 0011

Q: What happens if an item is out of stock? Do you offer rain checks?

A: For delivery and pickup, out-of-stock items are removed or substituted based on your preference; we don’t issue rain checks for online orders. In-store, select weekly-ad items may qualify for rain checks at the service desk (availability varies by location and promotion).



### 0012

Q: How do returns work for groceries?

A: If produce, meat, dairy, or prepared foods are unsatisfactory, request a replacement or refund within 48 hours via Order History (delivery/pickup) or at the service desk (in-store). For shelf-stable items, you can return unopened items within 14 days with a receipt.



### 0013
